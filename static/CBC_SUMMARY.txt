Structured Summary: Kenya Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC)
1. What is the CBC? (Vision, Mission & Background)
Full Name: The Competency Based Curriculum (CBC), outlined in the Basic Education Curriculum Framework (BECF).

Vision: To enable every Kenyan to become an engaged, empowered, and ethical citizen.

Mission: "Nurturing Every Learnerâ€™s Potential." The curriculum is designed to identify and nurture the unique potential, talents, and interests of every child, ensuring no child is labeled a failure.

Background: It replaced the 8-4-4 system to address:

Overemphasis on academic exams and rote memorization.

Curriculum overload and lack of practical skills.

High unemployment due to graduates lacking entrepreneurial skills.

Failure to identify and nurture individual talents early enough.

Theoretical Foundation: The CBC is underpinned by several educational theories, including:

Constructivism (Dewey, Vygotsky, Piaget): Learners construct knowledge through experience and social interaction.

Multiple Intelligences (Gardner): Learners have different strengths and ways of learning.

Visible Learning (Hattie): Teaching and learning must be visible and responsive to student needs.

2. The Structure of Basic Education
The CBC is organized into three main levels:

Early Years Education (5 Years)

Pre-Primary: 2 years (Age 4-5)

Lower Primary: 3 years (Grades 1-3, Age 6-8)

Middle School Education (6 Years)

Upper Primary: 3 years (Grades 4-6, Age 9-11)

Lower Secondary: 3 years (Grades 7-9, Age 12-14)

Senior School Education (3 Years)

Grades 10-12 (Age 15-17): This is where learners specialize in chosen pathways.

3. The Seven Core Competencies
The entire curriculum is designed to develop these seven core competencies in every learner:

Communication and Collaboration: Interacting effectively and working well in teams.

Self-Efficacy: Belief in one's capabilities to succeed; encompasses self-awareness, confidence, and resilience.

Critical Thinking and Problem Solving: Analysing situations and making reasoned judgments to solve problems.

Creativity and Imagination: Generating new ideas and turning them into reality.

Citizenship: Understanding rights and responsibilities, and contributing to local and global communities.

Digital Literacy: Effectively and safely using a wide range of digital devices and content.

Learning to Learn: The ability to pursue and persist in learning, and to organize one's own learning.

4. Subject Areas by Level (A Snapshot)
Pre-Primary: Language, Mathematical, Environmental, Psychomotor and Creative, and Religious Education Activities.

Lower Primary (Grades 1-3): Literacy, Kiswahili, English, Indigenous Language, Mathematics, Environmental Activities, Hygiene & Nutrition, Religious Education, Movement & Creative Activities.

Upper Primary (Grades 4-6): English, Kiswahili/KSL, Mathematics, Science & Technology, Social Studies, Religious Education (CRE/IRE/HRE), Creative Arts, Physical and Health Education, Home Science, Agriculture. (Optional: Foreign Languages).

Lower Secondary (Grades 7-9):

Core Subjects (All learners take these): English, Kiswahili/KSL, Mathematics, Integrated Science, Health Education, Pre-Technical & Pre-Career, Social Studies, Religious Education, Business Studies, Agriculture, Life Skills, Sports & PE.

Optional Subjects (Choose 1-2): Visual Arts, Performing Arts, Home Science, Computer Science, Foreign Languages, Indigenous Languages.

5. Senior School Pathways and Tracks (The Specialization Stage)
After Lower Secondary, learners choose one of three pathways based on their interests, talents, and abilities.

Pathway 1: Arts and Sports Science (~
15% of learners)

Tracks:

Performing Arts: Music, Dance, Theatre & Elocution.

Visual & Applied Arts: Fine Art, Applied Art, Time-Based Media, Crafts.

Sports Science: Ball Games, Athletics, Indoor Games, Water Sports, Martial Arts, etc.

Pathway 2: Social Sciences (~
25% of learners)

Tracks:

Humanities & Business Studies: History & Citizenship, Geography, CRE/IRE/HRE, Business Studies, Mathematics.

Languages & Literature: English, Literature in English, Kiswahili (Lugha & Fasihi), Foreign Languages, Indigenous Languages.

Pathway 3: Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) (~
60% of learners)

Tracks:

Pure Sciences: Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology.

Applied Sciences: Agriculture, Computer Science, Foods & Nutrition, Home Management.

Technical & Engineering: Electrical, Mechanical, and Civil Engineering technologies, Geosciences, Aviation, etc.

Career and Technology Studies (CTS): Highly practical subjects leading to artisan certification (e.g., Carpentry, Plumbing, Hair Dressing, Culinary Arts, Motor Vehicle Mechanics, Tourism).

6. Assessment in the CBC
Assessment is a blend of formative and summative, with a strong emphasis on continuous growth.

Formative Assessment (Assessment for Learning):

Purpose: To monitor learning progress and provide ongoing feedback.

Methods: Observations, oral questions, quizzes, projects, portfolios, journals, peer assessment, self-assessment.

Focus: Identifying learning gaps and guiding improvement. It is continuous and integrated into daily teaching.

Summative Assessment (Assessment of Learning):

Purpose: To evaluate learning at the end of a period (term, year, or level).

Methods: Kenya National Examinations Council (KNEC) assessments at the end of Grade 6 (Upper Primary), Grade 9 (Lower Secondary), and Grade 12 (Senior School).

Focus: In Senior School, learners in the Career and Technology Studies (CTS) track receive Dual Certification: a KNEC certificate and an Artisan Level certificate, making them job-ready.

7. Inclusion and Pertinent Issues
Education for Learners with Special Needs: The CBC is fully inclusive. It provides a differentiated curriculum with modalities for:

Learners who can follow the regular curriculum with adaptations.

Learners who follow a specialized, stage-based curriculum (Foundation, Intermediate, Pre-Vocational, Vocational levels) focused on life skills and independence.

Pertinent and Contemporary Issues (PCIs): These are cross-cutting themes integrated into all subjects to ensure relevance. They include:

Global Citizenship (Peace, Human Rights, Social Cohesion)

Health Education (HIV/AIDS, Drug Abuse)

Life Skills and Values

Education for Sustainable Development (Environmental Education, Financial Literacy)

Learner Support Programs (Guidance, Clubs)

Community Service Learning & Parental Engagement

8. Key Supporting Elements
Community Service Learning (CSL): A compulsory subject in Senior School where learners apply knowledge to solve real community problems and log at least 135 hours of service.

Parental Empowerment and Engagement: Parents are recognized as critical partners. The framework guides schools on how to engage parents at every level, from understanding the curriculum to supporting career choices.

Guiding Principles: The CBC is built on principles of Opportunity, Excellence, Diversity & Inclusion, and Differentiated Learning.
